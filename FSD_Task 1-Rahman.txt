Guvi-Task_2:

1. Write a blog on the difference between document and window object?

Window object :

The window object represents an open window in a browser.
If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.

some of the most used window object properties are follows
console - Returns the Console Object for the window
document
frames

window object methods :
addEventListener(), alert(), confirm(), close(), open(), prompt(),etc..,

In VS code you can access the window object by using the syntax : 
console.group(window)
Note : It includes all functionality of browser window

Document : 

When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object.
The document object is the root node of the HTML document.
The document object is a property of the window object.
The document object is accessed with: window.document or just document

Eg..,

let url = window.document.URL;
console.log(url);
o/p: file:///D:/FSD_Guvi/FSD/fsd.html

2. Codekata practice

Some of the problem in the GUVI IDE can be easily done but in some case it is tought to understand the problem statement and also exactly 
dont know how and where to start? but if the mentor guides, it is easy to get the problem statement and also getting some idea to approach the 
problem.
